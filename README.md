Makers Academy Chitter Challenge
================================

I am creating a very simple Twitter clone, 'Chitter', to demonstrate the use of Relational databases in basic web apps. This will be Test-Driven using Rspec, with the code being handled by Ruby/Sinatra. Database relationships are being handled with DataMapper/Postgres.
